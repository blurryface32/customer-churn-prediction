This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

Model Evaluation: 
Evaluating prediction using Confusion matrix


```{r}
confusionMatrix(data=churn_test$glm.Label, reference=churn_test$Churn, positive="Yes")


```


1. Accuracy rate: 73%

Means that the model could predict accurately of Churn and Not Churn class (compared to data test) for 73%
Predict True as Churn: 290 (out of 372)
Predicted True as Not Churn: 733 (out 0f 1031)

2. Focus output: Sensitivity Rate 78%

Means that the model accurately predict True Positive (true prediction to customer churn), and false prediction as customer wonâ€™t churn (but, customer does churn on data test) is 78%
Predict True as Churn: 290 (out of 372)
Predicted True as Not Churn: 82 (out 0f 372)


```{r}

churn_test$glm.Label.4 <- ifelse(churn_test$glm.prediction > 0.45, "Yes" , "No") %>% as.factor()
confusionMatrix(data=churn_test$glm.Label.4, reference=churn_test$Churn, positive="Yes")
```
Sensitivity rate increase to 80%, and decreased 10 false negative prediction compared to previous threshold (0.5)
